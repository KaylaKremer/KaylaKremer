### Hi there 👋🏻

My name is Kayla and I'm a front-end React developer! I've worked professionally in the software industry for 3+ years now and I have an formal fine arts education in videogame design. I love the intersection of when code meets art to create engaging, interactive, and accessible experiences with. I am currently studying creative coding with THREE.js and GSAP 3 and am building out my new portfolio site with it. In the meantime, feel free to visit my very old and outdated site at www.kaylakremer.com. 


#### Fun facts <br />
⛩️ I used to live & work in Japan as an English teacher <br />
🎮 I have a 3D model I made that got selected by Steam to be put in the videogame *Team Fortress 2* <br />
👩🏼‍💻 I taught myself how to code with just some textbooks and online video tutorials! <br />

Feel free to get in contact with me via kremer.kayla@gmail.com if you have any job opportunities or project collabs you think I'd be a great match for!
