### Hi there 👋🏻

My name is Kayla and I'm a front-end React developer! 👩🏼‍💻<br />

I've worked professionally in the software industry for 3+ years now and I have an formal fine arts education in videogame design. I love the intersection of when code meets art to create engaging, interactive, and accessible experiences with. I am currently studying creative coding with THREE.js and GSAP 3 and am building out my new portfolio site with it. In the meantime, you can visit my old site at www.kaylakremer.com.
